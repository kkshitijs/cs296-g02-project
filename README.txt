The directory structure followed is :

	-> src : same as base-code
	-> external : same as base-code, but b2Timer.cpp and b2Timer.h are the patched versions being used
	-> bin : created while installing the project. the executable, which has GUI enabled, is generated here
	-> html : the project main webpage is here. the timing report is generated here in html after parsing the tex file
	-> doc : contains the images in .png and .eps formats needed for the reports and html pages. Also, the Doxygen commented code is generated here under "html" directory
	-> data : created while installing the project. the profile.dat, the call graphs etc. generated from profiling are here
	-> scripts : the python scripts to generate tex2html, the csv_generator, plot-generator from Matplotlib and gprof2dot.py is here
	-> obj : created while installing the project. stores the object files of the corresponding source files in src.
	-> plots : created while installing the project. stores the timing plots generated by running the python script
